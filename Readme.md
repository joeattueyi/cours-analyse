# A course in Analysis

This is an English translation of Camille Jordan's *Cours d'Analyse*, 2nd edition.

Jordan's *Cours d'Analyse* is the work from which most mathematicians at the beginning of the 20th century learned analysis. Even the great Freeman Dyson said he learned analysis from it. I always wanted to read it but there is no English or Italian translations available.

Since I didn't know French I decided to kill two birds with one stone and learn the language while doing something interesting.
