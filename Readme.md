# A course in Analysis

This is an English translation of Camille Jordan's *Cours d'Analyse*, 2nd edition.

Jordan's *Cours d'Analyse* is the work from which most mathematicians from the end of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century learned analysis. 

I always wanted to read it but there is no English or Italian translations available. Since I didn't know French I decided to learn the language while doing something interesting.

## Originals
